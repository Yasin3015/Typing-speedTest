# Typing Speed Test

This project is a front-end project as an application on what i studied in the last period.I hope you like it.


## Project Idea
This project measures the speed of typing on the keyboard. through three levels. Each level has a number of words and a specific time to write each word. If the time expires and you do not write the word correctly, the test ends.
